1.  Javascript is a prototype-based model. This provides dynamic inheritance i.e. what is inherited can vary for 
    individual objects.
2.  Javascript supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be  properties of Objects,
    executing as loosely typed methods.
3.  Javascript is Object-Oriented. Variable data types are not declared. Cannot automatically write to Hard Disk. There 
    is no distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through prototype mechanism, properties and methods can 
    be added to any object dynamically.
